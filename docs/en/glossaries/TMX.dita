    <glossdef>Translation Memory eXchange (TMX) is an open standard originally published by LISA
        (Localization Industry Standards Association). The purpose of TMX is to allow easier
        exchange of translation memory data between tools and/or translation vendors with little or
        no loss of critical data during the process.</glossdef>
