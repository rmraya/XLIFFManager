<!-- This is the driver file for V4.3 of the DocBook DTD.
     Please use the following formal public identifier to identify it:

     "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V4.3//EN"

     For example, if your document's top-level element is Book, and
     you are using DocBook directly, use the FPI in the DOCTYPE
     declaration:

     <!DOCTYPE Book PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V4.3//EN" [...]>

     Or, if you have a higher-level driver file that customizes DocBook,
     use the FPI in the parameter entity declaration:

     <!ENTITY % DocBookDTD PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V4.3//EN">
     %DocBookDTD;

     The DocBook DTD is accompanied by an SGML declaration.

     See the documentation for detailed information on the parameter
     entity and module scheme used in DocBook, customizing DocBook and
     planning for interchange, and changes made since the last release
     of DocBook.
